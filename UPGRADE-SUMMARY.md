## 🚨 BREAKING CHANGES

1. **Authentication Required**: Must set `BASIC_AUTH_USER` and `BASIC_AUTH_PWD`
2. **API Responses**: Changed from plain text to JSON format
3. **Dangerous Commands**: Some commands will now be rejected
4. **Node.js Version**: Requires Node.js >=18.0.0

## 🚀 QUICK START

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Set authentication (REQUIRED)
export BASIC_AUTH_USER="your_username"
export BASIC_AUTH_PWD="your_secure_password"

# 3. Start application
npm start
# OR use the security-enhanced startup script:
./start-secure.sh
```

## 🔐 DEFAULT CREDENTIALS WARNING

If you don't set authentication credentials, the app will use:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `changeme`

**⚠️ CHANGE THESE IMMEDIATELY!**

## 📋 SECURITY CHECKLIST

- [ ] Set strong authentication credentials
- [ ] Enable HTTPS for production (`SSL_KEY` and `SSL_CERT`)
- [ ] Review all existing cron jobs for blocked commands
- [ ] Test all functionality before production deployment
- [ ] Monitor logs for security events
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies
- [ ] Backup crontab database regularly

## 🎯 KEY SECURITY FEATURES

1. **Command Filtering**: Prevents dangerous system commands
2. **Authentication**: Required for all access
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force and DoS attacks
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs sanitized and validated
5. **Security Headers**: CSP, XSS protection, and more
6. **Error Handling**: No information leakage in production
7. **Audit Trail**: Enhanced logging for security monitoring

## 📁 NEW FILES CREATED

- `SECURITY.md` - Comprehensive security documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Detailed changelog with all improvements
- `start-secure.sh` - Security-focused startup script

## 🔄 MIGRATION NOTES

When upgrading from v0.3.x:
1. Set authentication credentials before starting
2. Update any integration scripts expecting text responses
3. Review existing cron jobs for blocked commands
4. Test in non-production environment first
5. Update Node.js to version 18+ if needed
